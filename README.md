# upskillCampus

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a machine learning-based traffic pattern forecasting system. The system leverages an ensemble of machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, Neural Network Regressor, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, to predict traffic patterns in a smart city environment.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Jyputer Notebook (Online - Google Colab)
- [Required Python packages, e.g., scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm, etc.]

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShelinVankawala/upskillCampus.git
